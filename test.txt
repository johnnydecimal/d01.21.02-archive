Hi everyone. A quick note, with more to follow next week.

This mailing list will become a quarterly publication. I’ll consolidate the two existing lists, ‘mail me more often’, and ‘mail me less frequently’. Turns out I mail you less frequently anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I’ll be sending the first Decimal Quarterly next week, which you may consider the late winter 2024 edition. (Remember, I’m in the Southern Hemisphere.)

As part of this, I WILL BE MOVING YOUR ADDRESS TO A NEW LIST hosted at https://mailmanlists.net.

They’re Australian and very privacy focused. The Mailman software  is decades old, plain text, and as far as I’m aware couldn’t track you even if you wanted it to.

That said, I wanted to let you know before I move your address over. Let’s say I’ll do that next ... checks his calendar ... Thursday lunchtime. One week from now.

If you don’t want me to do that, just unsubscribe from this list. And of course you can always unsubscribe from the new list.

Until next week,
j.
