The Johnny.Decimal Workshop is now available for pre-sale. It launches in April.

Last year, I wrote a book. Which you bought! Hence this email.

This year, we bring the book to life. We use it to organise my partner Lucy\'s life.

▶ 14.03 The Johnny.Decimal Workshop - https://jdcm.al/14.03 ◀

Normally US$149, the public pre-sale price is US$49.

But you\'ve already given me US$37 for the Workbook. Here at JDHQ we refer to you as \'the Johnny.Decimal family\', and we like to look after family. So here\'s an offer:

▶ The Workshop for $12: the difference between the pre-sale price and what you\'ve already paid. ◀

If you\'d like to take advantage of this offer, here\'s a link.

We hope you join us. We can\'t wait for you to see it.
