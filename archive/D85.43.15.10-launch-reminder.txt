Hi. Just a quick note as I notice you haven\'t signed in to the Johnny.Decimal Workshop since it launched. So you may have missed the launch email.

It\'s now live. You can sign in here.

The next of our classes starts on Sunday 19th May, so if you want to do the Workshop in a group, that\'s a great day to start. The first class is going really well. Take a peek here.

I won\'t nag you again. :-)
