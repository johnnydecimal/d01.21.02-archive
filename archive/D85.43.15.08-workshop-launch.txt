The Johnny.Decimal Workshop will be released on Sunday 28th April at 14:00 AET (UTC+10). At this time, we will publish the lessons. Refreshing your course page will show them.

To sign in, visit https://courses.johnnydecimal.com/users/sign_in.

The Workshop is pre-recorded, so you can watch the videos on your own schedule. But we also have opt-in ‘classes’ where you move through the workshop at a set pace.

Joining a class means signing up to a forum thread with other people who are starting the workshop the same week as you.

You’ll aim to complete each workshop area on a schedule, with your classmates. 

You can share your progress or questions with others at the same stage as you. And stay motivated by being part of a group.

The first class starts on Sunday. Introduce yourself at https://forum.johnnydecimal.com/t/workshop-class-2024-04-28/1370.

See you there!
