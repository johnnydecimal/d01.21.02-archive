Hi everyone. Just a quick update on the Johnny.Decimal Workshop which, as promised, is coming in April.

We\'re working hard on it basically 7 days a week. Lucy\'s sitting next to me editing right now, and we just planned the next area on the whiteboard...

...but when we said \'coming in April\' we kinda always knew that it would be the _end_ of April. ;-) Planning, recording, and editing video takes longer than you ever imagine it will.

We love what we\'ve done so far. Hang in there! Just a few more weeks.

j & l.
